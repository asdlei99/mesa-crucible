Urgent
======
- Support multiple command buffers after Mesa gets fixed.
- Add a --diff option to crucible-run that dumps image diffs for failed tests.
  (Requires multiple command buffers).
- Add an option to crucible-run that selects how the runner isolates tests:
  one thread per test, one process per test, or no isolation.

Important
=========
- Add optional printf-style parameters to cru_assert() and cru_fail().
- Generate some wrapper headers for the Vulkan API that provide type-safety and
  reduce boilerplate. Having real types would simplify the test cleanup API too.
- Fail test if any vk function fails, unless the test explicitly expects an
  error.

Rainy Day
=========
- Add an example multi-threaded test, "example.threads".
- Consolidate some crucible headers. There are too many.
- Clean up the messy cru_image code.
