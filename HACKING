Directory Layout
================

WARNING: IN FLUX!

- data
  Data files for tests, such as reference images, vertex data, texture
  images, etc.

- misc
  If you want Crucible to play nicely with bash, zsh, vim, emacs, or whatever,
  then look in misc/.

- include
  Headers under include/ are public within the project. That is, they define
  API that is available to the entire codebase.  This contrasts with headers
  under src/, which are private to their containing directory.

- src/crucible
  Source for the test framework, but not the tests themselves. Consider this
  directory Crucible's "standard library", intended to be used by tests.  This
  includes the test runner (the crucible command), png and image tools, logging
  code, and generally any common code shared among many tests.

- src/tests
  Source for the tests themselves.

- src/tests/examples
  Example tests that demonstrate how to use the framework or how to accomplish
  a tricky testing task.

- src/tests/func: Functional tests

- src/tests/stress: Stress tests


Writing Tests
=============
Tests live in the 'src/tests' directory. The Crucible API available to tests is
in 'include/crucible/cru.h'. (Headers in 'src/crucible' are private to
Crucible's test framework and are not available to the tests themselves).

After writing a test, you will likely need to generate a reference image for
it.  The command 'crucible bootstrap' can generate one for you.

All images in the 'data' directory are available to tests. You can load an
image with `cru_image_load_file(filename)`, where filename is relative to the
'data' directory.
