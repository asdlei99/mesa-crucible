Crucible: a Vulkan testsuite

  cru·ci·ble
  ˈkro͞osəb(ə)l/
  noun

  [literal] a ceramic or metal container in which metals or other substances
  may be melted or subjected to very high temperatures.

  [symbolic] a place or occasion of severe test or trial.
  ex: "the crucible of combat"


Building
========
Do the autotools dance:

  $ autoreconf -vfi
  $ ./configure
  $ make

The configure script will search for Vulkan headers and libraries in the usual
system locations.  You can modify the search paths with environment variables
CPATH and LIBRARY_PATH [see man:gcc(1)].  If you want to configure Crucible to
use the headers and libraries contained in a Mesa source directory, then pass
--with-mesa=$MESA_DIR to the configure script.


Running Tests
=============
If you alter your environment's PATH, then you can run the testsuite from any
directory:

  $ export PATH="$CRU_TOP/bin:$PATH"

If you use Bash, we recommend you enable bash-completion:

  $ source $CRU_TOP/misc/crucible-completion.bash

To list all tests:

  $ crucible ls-tests

To run all tests:

  $ crucible run

To run specific tests:

  $ crucible run functional.basic-clear
  $ crucible run functional.basic-clear info.device-properties

The run command also supports glob patterns:

  $ crucible run 'functional.draw*indirect' 'functional.miptree.*'
