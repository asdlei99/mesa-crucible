tldr; The tests are run by `make check`. Do not run them with crucible-run.

This directory contains self-tests for Crucible. That is, these tests check the
correctness of Crucible itself.

The crucible-run command excludes self-tests by default. To run them, you must
provide a matching glob pattern.  For example, to run all self-tests, execute
`crucible run 'self.*'`. However, as explained below, the test results will be
inconclusive.

Some self-tests produce output that require external verification, for example,
by a script.  The result of such a test, when run with crucible-run, is
inconclusive without also running its verification script. To run all
self-tests automatically along with their verification scripts, run `make
check`.
