///    - Tests can load miptrees by a sequence of:
///
///         file_img = cru_image_load_file(filename
///         cru_image_copy(tex_image, file_img);
///
///    - Tests can probe render targets with:
///
///         file_img = cru_image_load_file(filename
///         cru_image_compare(tex_image, file_img);
///
///    - Test authors can create new images with:
///
///         cru_image_write_file(tex_image, filename);
///
///    - Images created by cru_image_from_pixels() are read-write.
///
///    - Images created by cru_image_load_file() are read-only.
///
///    - Images hold no reference on their storage. For example, pixel images
///      do not own the backing pixel array.
